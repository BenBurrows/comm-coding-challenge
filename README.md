# comm-coding-challenge
This project will hold all the code for the #comm-coding-challenge.

Each challenge will be in it's own package e.g. com.davidbevan.challenge1.*

The challenges can be executed by running ./gradlew check (to run all the unit tests for all challenges) or by selecting the appropriate test class (tests are also grouped in packages by challenge)
