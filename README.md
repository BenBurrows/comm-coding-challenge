# comm-coding-challenge
This project will hold all the code for the #comm-coding-challenge.

Each challenge will be in it's own package e.g. com.davidbevan.challenge1.*

The challenges can be executed by running ./gradlew check (to run all the unit tests for all challenges) or by selecting the appropriate test class (tests are also grouped in packages by challenge)

Additionally, each package may contain a Main class enabling the test to be run from the command line or from "run configurations"

When run from Main class the following paramters should be used...

Challenge1: "Main {seconds}"

Challenge2: (didn't complete due to holiday)
 
Challenge3: "No Main, see println output from tests" 

Challenge4: "(didn't complete due to training course)" 

Challenge5: "Run Connect4Test unit tests" 

Challenge6: "Run FilterTest unit tests"

Challenge7: "Main {tbc}"

Challenge8: "Main {tbc}"
